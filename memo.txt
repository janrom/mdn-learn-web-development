# LOADING SCRIPTS
- add javascript-file loading script-tag inside head-section
    - use defer or async -flags
        - use defer when scripts must be downloaded in specific order (is they are dependent from each other)
        - use async if scripts are independent
    - putting script-tags before closing html-tag is old school, which have performance issues when site uses lot's of javascript
        (scripts are blocked until whole html dom is loaded).
